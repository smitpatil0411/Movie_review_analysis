"# Movie_review_analysis" 
This project  develops a machine learning model for sentiment analysis on movie reviews, with the goal of automatically classifying reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text. The project involves:

Data Collection: Gathering data from sources such as IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes or any other sources.
Text Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data by removing noise and normalizing the text.
Model Selection and Training: Choosing and training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines.(we chose logistic regression)
Performance Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
The deployed model will provide insights into audience sentiment towards movies, benefiting filmmakers, studios, and review websites by informing decision-making processes and enhancing the understanding of audience preferences.
